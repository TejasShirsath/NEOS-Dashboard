# NEOS Dashboard 🌌

The **NEOS Dashboard** (Near-Earth Object Dashboard) is a React-based web application that tracks and visualizes near-Earth asteroids using NASA's API. It provides insights such as velocity, size, approach date, and hazard status, displayed through an interactive dashboard.



## Features ✨

- **Real-Time Data**: Fetches up-to-date information on near-Earth objects.
- **Orbital Visualization**: Displays an interactive orbital map of NEOs with planetary orbits.
- **Detailed Asteroid Information**: Displays velocity, size, approach date, and hazard status.
- **Date Filtering**: Users can specify a start and end date to filter asteroid data.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The asteroid list and visualization dynamically update based on the selected date range.
